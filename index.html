                    <p class="caption">Over the past five years, utility-scale lithium-ion battery capacity in the U.S. has grown from 1.0 GW in January 2020 to 28.5 GW in March 2025. By the end of 2025, an additional 18.2 GW is planned to come online, as shown in orange. California leads the charge with 12.1 GW installed, followed by Texas with 7.9 GW and Arizona with 2.5 GW. Together, these three states account for 79% of the nationâ€™s capacity. Each battery can supply its maximum power for a set duration, which typically falls between 1 and 4 hours.

                    <p class="caption">Grid operators across the country expect an increase in annual peak demand, the highest electricity load over any hour in a given year, for the first time in two decades. The electrification of industries, homes, and transportation as well as new data centers are driving up forecasts of demand. 
                        Texas, with a growing economy and population, expects peak load to rise from 
                        85 GW in 2024 to 154 GW in 2035, an 80% increase. In the Mid-Atlantic region, PJM, the operator of the nation's largest grid, anticipates a 38% rise in peak power demand this decade, from 151 GW to 209 GW. 
                        The New England system operator expects winter peak demand in the region to grow from 20 GW to 28 GW by 2035, largely due to 
                        the electrification of heating and transportation. Data sources: <a href="https://www.ercot.com/" target="_blank">ERCOT</a>, <a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank">PJM</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/" target="_blank">ISO-NE</a>.</p>

                    <p class="caption">In the three years since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
                        countries in the European Union have reduced their combined imports of Russian natural gas 
                        by 75%. The decrease has been partially offset by a tripling in U.S. liquefied natural gas 
                        imports since the start of 2022. Overall gas imports to Europe have fallen 19% in this 
                        three-year period. This decline is in part due to a reduction in consumption by industries in 
                        response to record high prices as well as a continued shift to renewables and energy 
                        efficiency. On May 5, 2025, the European Commission shared <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0440R(01)" target="_blank">plans</a> to stop all imports of 
                        Russian gas by the end of 2027.  Data source: <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/" target="_blank">Bruegel</a>.</p>

                        and May 1, 2025. Over the past five years, solar has expanded its share, while
                        electricity imports from other western states have declined. Batteries, shown in purple,
                        have become a significant part of the mix in recent years. At 8 pm on May 1, 2025, for example,
                        batteries were supplying 34% of the state's electricity. Data source: California ISO via <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io" target="_blank">Grid Status</a>.</p>
