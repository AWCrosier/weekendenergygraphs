                        while the number of acres burned each year has risen. From 1985 to 1995, fires burned an average of 
                        3.0 million acres per year. From 2012 to 2022, that average jumped to 7.2 million 
                        acres per year. Warmer temperatures have dried vegetation leading to longer fire seasons 
                        and larger burns. The strength of fires has increased despite additional suppression efforts: 
                        In the 1990s, the federal government spent $453 million per year on firefighting efforts. In the 
                        2010s that spending rose to an average of $1.91 billion per year, a 2.5x increase (inflation adjusted).

                    <p class="caption">To ensure its system has adequate resources to meet demand in future years, a grid 
                        operator typically administers a competitive capacity market. Last year, capacity prices in PJM spiked 
                        from $28.92/MW-day to $269.92/MW-day. The 9x increase came from a combination of rising data center load 
                        growth, generator retirements, and changes to PJM’s capacity accreditation methods. In part responding 
                        to a complaint by Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, PJM and FERC approved a two year “price collar” in 
                        the capacity market. This year, prices rose again and hit the price cap at $329.17. The price collar 
                        reduces volatility and protects consumers from cost spikes. However, it also distorts market signals 
                        in a region where supply is already falling behind rising demand.

                        third highest peak demand of all time. To keep electricity flowing to 67 million people, 
                        the grid operator called on contracted demand response resources. By participating in 
                        demand response, industrial, commercial, and residential customers receive payments for 
                        reducing their consumption during peak hours. Economic demand response occurs when 
                        electricity prices cross thresholds agreed upon with customers. Load management demand 
                        response occurs when the grid operator calls on contracted resources during an emergency. 
                        In the evening of June 24, demand response contributed 4.3 gigawatts of power to the 
                        system, roughly equal to adding four nuclear reactors. Data Source:

                    <p class="caption">On July 4, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act 
                        into law, bringing an earlier end to tax credits for wind, solar, and EVs. In 
                        2022, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded federal support for advanced energy 
                        technologies, including  a $7,500 credit for electric vehicles and larger investment 
                        and production tax credits for renewables. The new Act ends the EV credit at the end 
                        of September 2025, seven years before the previous deadline. Additionally, for new 
                        wind and solar plants to qualify for the investment tax credit or production tax 
                        credit, their construction must begin before July 4, 2026, or they must enter into 
                        service before the end of 2027. The new Act did spare some clean energy technologies, 
                        leaving support for energy storage and clean baseload power (including geothermal and 
                        nuclear) unchanged from the existing timeline. Source:

                    <p class="caption">In March 2025, the average residential rate for electricity across the nation was 17.11 
                        cents per kilowatt-hour. However, households in different regions paid different rates: Idaho residents 
                        paid an average of 11.56 cents/kWh, while those in Connecticut paid 32.55 cents/kWh—nearly three times 
                        as much. The retail rate reflects the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution, each of which 
                        is impacted by different factors. For example, California’s wildfire mitigation and grid hardening 
                        efforts raise the costs of transmission and distribution. In states with higher wages, taxes, or 
                        clean energy standards, utilities may charge higher rates to cover related costs as well.

                        computing data centers. At the same time, Google, Microsoft, and Meta aim to achieve net zero 
                        emissions by 2030. To secure one source of continuous, carbon-free power, they have made large 
                        deals with nuclear energy companies. With multi-decade agreements, tech companies have revitalized 
                        economically troubled plants such as Three Mile Island. They have also invested billions of dollars 
                        into small modular reactors (SMRs), a new generation of fission reactors with the potential to be 
                        cheaper and easier to build. Most SMRs however are not expected to come online for another decade. 
                        If executed, these eight projects above will total to over 15,000 MW, enough power for roughly 12 
                        million homes yet only a fraction of forecasted data center demand in the coming decades.

                    <p class="caption">In 2004, the U.S. generated 53% of its electricity from coal-fired power 
                        plants and 19% from natural gas plants. In 2024, coal’s share of production has dropped 
                        to 15% while the share from natural gas has risen to 43%. Since the start of the “shale 
                        revolution” in the early 2000s, natural gas has fallen in price and forced coal plants to 
                        close largely for economic reasons. In addition to using cheaper fuel, natural gas plants 
                        are more flexible and emit less CO2 than coal plants. Lower gas prices have 
                        limited the growth of nuclear energy as well and forced some reactors to close. Of any 
                        technology, wind and solar have grown the most over the past two decades, rising in 
                        their share of electricity production from less than 1% to over 17%.

                    <p class="caption">California continues to rapidly grow its utility-scale solar 
                        capacity. Total solar generation in the state increased by 47% from 2021 to 
                        2024. Sometimes during the day, solar production exceeds the amount that the current transmission system
                        can support, requiring the grid operator to shut off some of the supply. Most 
                        of this curtailment occurs during the spring, when there is ample sun but lower 
                        demand due to moderate temperatures. In March 2025, for example, the 
                        California ISO shut off 18% of total solar generation for the month. To reduce curtailment, 
                        California is expanding its transmission infrastructure and promoting 
                        additional flexible resources such as batteries. Data source: CAISO

                    <p class="caption">Global electric vehicle sales continue to grow, with more than one EV for every five cars sold in 2024. 
                        Last year, EVs accounted for 10% of car sales in the United States, 22% in Europe, and 48% in China. Norway leads the 
                        world in EV adoption, with 89% of all new cars being fully battery powered. The Scandinavian country has significant 
                        government incentives for EVs and has built an extensive charging network. Domestically, Norway is moving towards its 
                        climate goals, with an electricity grid powered by 97% renewables. However, oil and gas account for two-thirds of the 
                        country’s exports. Data source: <a href="https://www.iea.org/" target="_blank">IEA</a>.

                    <p class="caption">Over the past five years, utility-scale lithium-ion battery capacity in the U.S. has grown from 1.0 GW in January 2020 to 28.5 GW in March 2025. By the end of 2025, an additional 18.2 GW is planned to come online, as shown in orange. California leads the charge with 12.1 GW installed, followed by Texas with 7.9 GW and Arizona with 2.5 GW. Together, these three states account for 79% of the nation's battery capacity. Each battery can supply its maximum power for a set duration, which typically falls between 1 and 4 hours.

                    <p class="caption">Grid operators across the country expect an increase in annual peak demand, the highest electricity load over any hour in a given year, for the first time in two decades. The electrification of industries, homes, and transportation as well as new data centers are driving up forecasts of demand. 
                        Texas, with a growing economy and population, expects peak load to rise from 
                        85 GW in 2024 to 154 GW in 2035, an 80% increase. In the Mid-Atlantic region, PJM, the operator of the nation's largest grid, anticipates a 38% rise in peak power demand this decade, from 151 GW to 209 GW. 
                        The New England system operator expects winter peak demand in the region to grow from 20 GW to 28 GW by 2035, largely due to 
                        the electrification of heating and transportation. Data sources: <a href="https://www.ercot.com/" target="_blank">ERCOT</a>, <a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank">PJM</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/" target="_blank">ISO-NE</a>.</p>

                    <p class="caption">In the three years since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
                        countries in the European Union have reduced their combined imports of Russian natural gas 
                        by 75%. The decrease has been partially offset by a tripling in U.S. liquefied natural gas 
                        imports since the start of 2022. Overall gas imports to Europe have fallen 19% in this 
                        three-year period. This decline is in part due to a reduction in consumption by industries in 
                        response to record high prices as well as a continued shift to renewables and energy 
                        efficiency. On May 5, 2025, the European Commission shared <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0440R(01)" target="_blank">plans</a> to stop all imports of 
                        Russian gas by the end of 2027.  Data source: <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/" target="_blank">Bruegel</a>.</p>

                        electricity imports from other western states have declined. Batteries, shown in purple,
                        have become a significant part of the mix in recent years. At 8 pm on May 1, 2025, for example,
                        batteries were supplying 34% of the state's electricity. Data source: California ISO via <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io" target="_blank">Grid Status</a>.</p>
