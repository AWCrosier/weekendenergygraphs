                        southeastern New Mexico, produces about 45% of U.S. crude oil and 15% of the nation’s natural 
                        gas. Oil and gas operations in the Permian are rapidly switching the way they power their 
                        operations from onsite diesel or gas generators to electricity from the grid. Ironically, a 
                        large fraction of the grid power in this region comes from wind and solar. The rapid 
                        electrification has led some analysts to forecast a tripling of electricity demand in 
                        the region over the next decade. In response to growing load, both ERCOT and Southwest 
                        Power Pool have recently approved 765 kV transmission buildouts. These lines, estimated 
                        to cost $13.8 billion in ERCOT and $8.6 billion in SPP, will be the highest voltage lines 
                        built in either RTO. Source: <a href="https://www.spp.org/" target="_blank">SPP</a> and <a href="https://www.ercot.com/" target="_blank">ERCOT</a>.

                    <p class="caption">Electricity demand in New England has been flat for the past 20 years, and peak demand in summer has been approximately 25% higher than in winter. However, New England’s grid 
                        operator forecasts winter peak demand to double over the next two decades, rising from 20 GW today to 40 GW in 2045. 
                        The major driver of this load growth is the electrification of transportation and heating. ISO-NE expects 70% of homes 
                        in the region (4.4 million) to use electric space heating by 2050. Winter blackouts are generally more dangerous than 
                        summer outages because homes can lose heat in a matter of hours, creating the risk of frozen pipes and even hypothermia.

                        fleet tankers mask their activities by manipulating Automatic Identification Systems and 
                        disguising cargo origins with ship-to-ship transfers. Previously made up largely of vessels 
                        carrying Iranian and Venezuelan oil, the shadow fleet has more than doubled in recent years 
                        as it now transports cargo from the world’s third-largest oil producer, Russia. In 2022, G7 
                        countries created a price cap on Russian oil to stifle the Kremlin's largest source of income. 
                        To bypass sanctions, Russia bought oil tankers and re-routed trade to China and India, building 
                        a shadow fleet of more than 500 tankers. In addition to economic and political impacts, the 
                        shadow fleet creates severe environmental risks. Many of these vessels are aging, uninsured, 
                        and poorly maintained. They routinely pass through sensitive marine ecosystems where an oil 
                        spill would cause catastrophic damage. Source: <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/en" target="_blank">S&P Global</a>.

                    <p class="date">November 23, 2025</p>
                    <p class="caption">In 2013, the California Independent System Operator published a chart of net load—the 
                        total load on the system minus wind and solar generation. During the day, solar power floods the grid 
                        leading to a dip in net load. In the evening net load rises sharply as the sun sets and demand 
                        increases. Ten years ago, CAISO noticed that the net load curve resembled the profile of a duck, 
                        with a dipping belly and rising neck. Today, abundant solar generation in California has made 
                        the duck more closely resemble a pelican. On November 8, 2025 for example, between 9:30 am and 1:00 pm 
                        renewables produced more energy than consumers in the state demanded. While the pelican curve shows a solar 
                        success story, it also creates significant challenges for CAISO system operators. The system needs 
                        batteries and thermal generators to ramp up by over 20,000 megawatts—roughly equivalent to 
                        turning on 20 nuclear reactors—in a two-hour period.

                    <p class="caption">The nation’s largest city could face electricity shortfalls as demand grows and aging 
                        gas turbines retire, according to a recent report by New York’s grid operator. To close future supply 
                        gaps, NYC is relying on multiple major projects, including the 1,250 MW Champlain Hudson Power Express 
                        transmission line (expected spring 2026), the 800 MW Empire Wind 1 project (2027), and the Propel NY 
                        Energy transmission project (2030). However, supply chain uncertainty and political risks could delay 
                        these timelines. Even with these projects delivering power on schedule, NYISO still identifies a risk 
                        of power deficiency in the city starting in summer 2029. A temporary solution indicated in 
                        NYISO’s report is retaining aging peakers under special reliability exceptions. However, current 
                        state emissions regulations regardless of these reliability exemptions require many of these 
                        facilities to retire by May 1, 2029 unless they are upgraded to use cleaner technology.

                    <p class="caption">In September 2020, the U.S. had 1.4 GW of batteries connected to the grid. Five 
                        years later, that number has grown to 37.1 GW. For comparison, the entire country of Spain draws 
                        about 37 GW on a hot summer day. Over two-thirds of the nation’s battery capacity is in 
                        California and Texas, with 38% and 30% respectively. As battery installations grew over the 
                        past five years, battery owners have changed how they operate them. In Texas, batteries can 
                        earn revenue in two ways: providing grid services or trading energy. (In other electricity 
                        markets batteries can also make money by providing capacity or resource adequacy.) As battery 
                        capacity grew in Texas, their participation saturated the smaller ancillary service markets. 
                        This market saturation has pushed battery operators to participate in day-ahead and real-time energy markets, 
                        charging with cheap solar power and discharging to supply higher demand in the evening. 
                        In fact, by the start of 2025 batteries made more money from energy arbitrage than ancillary 
                        services. Data source: ERCOT via <a href="https://modoenergy.com/" target="_blank">Modo Energy</a>.

                    <h2>China outpaces the world on new nuclear power</h2>
                    <p class="date">November 2, 2025</p>
                    <p class="caption">Around the world, there are 65 nuclear power plants under construction today. 33 of them 
                        are in China, totalling 37.9 GW of capacity or enough power for approximately 30 million homes. China is 
                        building nuclear plants for a few reasons. Firstly, China seeks to reduce their reliance on fossil 
                        fuels—which they import mostly from the Middle East and Russia—to protect their energy supply from 
                        disruption by geopolitical conflicts or trade tensions. Secondly, nuclear projects match Beijing’s 
                        ambitions to dominate high-tech sectors and advance the country’s industrial capabilities. Unlike 
                        China, the U.S. and E.U. have zero nuclear plants under construction today. The latest U.S. facility, 
                        Plant Vogtle in Georgia, came online seven years behind schedule and $17 billion over budget. High costs, 
                        complex regulations, and long construction times make nuclear unappealing in the U.S. and Europe, 
                        particularly compared to cheap gas and renewables.

                    <p class="date">October 26, 2025</p>
                    <p class="caption">In April 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission changed the state’s 
                        net-metering policy for rooftop solar. Prior to the change, every kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated 
                        by a customer’s solar panels reduced what they would pay their utility by one kWh. In effect, 
                        instead of buying power at the wholesale rate (roughly 2 to 6 cents per kWh), utilities 
                        were buying power from their customers at the full residential rate (33 cents per kWh). 
                        Utilities need to charge this higher rate to cover their transmission and distribution 
                        costs, including fixed costs such as grid hardening for wildfires. The former net-metering policies shift an estimated $6.5 billion per year onto households without solar panels. 
                        The new policy, often called Net Energy Metering 3.0, aimed to reduce this cost shift. When first implemented, applications for 
                        rooftop solar dropped and the share of homes installing batteries alongside solar panels 
                        rose significantly. While rooftop solar is still critically important, we need incentives 
                        for the technology to accurately reflect the value it provides to the electricity system.

                        have increased U.S. electricity rates over the past five years. Rates have gone up in regions with rooftop 
                        solar installments, declining system load, or state-led Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). However, 
                        the largest driver of higher bills is simply living in California, as wildfire damage and grid hardening 
                        efforts have created significant transmission and distribution costs for ratepayers in the state. Notably, utility-scale wind and 
                        solar buildout, outside of the 25% attributable to RPS policies, has not exerted upward pressure on 
                        prices. Full study: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2025.107516" target="_blank">LBNL</a>.

                        fuel (SAF, point G) as priced now, not factoring in subsidies, would make them unprofitable. 
                        Experts say we need breakthrough technology companies to decarbonize these industries, and 
                        those companies need subsidies to get to scale. The U.S. has several useful subsidies: 
                        Renewable Identification Numbers (RINS) under the renewable fuel standard (RFS); the 
                        lower carbon fuel standard (LCFS) present in California and other west-coast states; 
                        45Z (clean fuels federal tax credit); and 45Q (a highly bipartisan carbon capture tax credit). 
                        The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-proposes-new-renewable-fuel-standards-strengthen-us-energy-security-support-0" target="_blank">published plans</a> to continue to expand the Renewable Volumes 
                        Obligations (RVOs) which dictate the amount of biofuel big oil companies must subsidize

                        the start of 2025. Continued output hikes by OPEC+, paired with lukewarm demand from the 
                        world’s largest economies, have weakened oil prices. Crude prices have fallen to $60.53 
                        per barrel, down from the year's high of $78.71 in January. With tighter margins, oil 
                        majors such as Chevron and ExxonMobil are cutting headcount to contain costs. In an 
                        extreme move, upstream company ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off 
                        20–25% of its global workforce, with some employees receiving layoff notifications

                        needed. With a surplus of energy, suppliers need to pay buyers to take it. Generators continue to produce when prices are negative 
                        for two main reasons. Thermal generators often have start-up and shut-down costs making it expensive and time consuming to turn off. 
                        Wind and solar can be curtailed, but the government subsides they receive for producing energy outweigh the negative prices.

                        and decades from underinvestment from Puerto Rico’s financially challenged utility created an unreliable electricity system on the island. 
                        Severe weather events with inadequate repairs have also compromised the system. While Puerto Rico’s government has taken legislative steps

                        however, when the grid faces the most strain, these facilities often shut off. This graph overlays the energy demand from 
                        cryptocurrency mining during each day in June and July this year. On around 40% of evenings, when wholesale prices are highest, 
                        facilities reduce their load by 90-95%. Electricity costs make or break the profitability of a crypto mine. By curtailing 
                        operations, crypto miners not only save money on energy charges (MWh), but also can greatly reduce demand charges (MW). 
                        Transmission utilities levy demand charges using ERCOT’s Four Coincident Peak (4CP) methodology. They charge industrial 
                        customers based on their load during four system-wide peaks, the highest aggregate demand in June, July, August, and September. 
                        By predicting when these peaks might occur, and cutting off power during them, crypto miners can sink their next year’s 
                        demand charges to near $0, saving 10-20% on annual energy costs.

                        to a complaint by Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, PJM and FERC approved a two year “price collar” in

                        reduces volatility and protects consumers from cost spikes. However, it also distorts market signals

                    <p class="date">July 13, 2025</p>
                    <p class="caption">On July 4, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act 
                        into law, bringing an earlier end to tax credits for wind, solar, and EVs. In 
                        2022, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded federal support for advanced energy 
                        technologies, including  a $7,500 credit for electric vehicles and larger investment 
                        and production tax credits for renewables. The new Act ends the EV credit at the end 
                        of September 2025, seven years before the previous deadline. Additionally, for new 
                        wind and solar plants to qualify for the investment tax credit or production tax 
                        credit, their construction must begin before July 4, 2026, or they must enter into 
                        service before the end of 2027. The new Act did spare some clean energy technologies, 
                        leaving support for energy storage and clean baseload power (including geothermal and 
                        nuclear) unchanged from the existing timeline. Source:

                    <p class="caption">In March 2025, the average residential rate for electricity across the nation was 17.11 
                        cents per kilowatt-hour. However, households in different regions paid different rates: Idaho residents 
                        paid an average of 11.56 cents/kWh, while those in Connecticut paid 32.55 cents/kWh—nearly three times 
                        as much. The retail rate reflects the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution, each of which 
                        is impacted by different factors. For example, California’s wildfire mitigation and grid hardening 
                        efforts raise the costs of transmission and distribution. In states with higher wages, taxes, or 
                        clean energy standards, utilities may charge higher rates to cover related costs as well.

                    <p class="caption">Tech giants have a growing hunger for electricity to power their AI and cloud 
                        computing data centers. At the same time, Google, Microsoft, and Meta aim to achieve net zero 
                        emissions by 2030. To secure one source of continuous, carbon-free power, they have made large 
                        deals with nuclear energy companies. With multi-decade agreements, tech companies have revitalized 
                        economically troubled plants such as Three Mile Island. They have also invested billions of dollars 
                        into small modular reactors (SMRs), a new generation of fission reactors with the potential to be 
                        cheaper and easier to build. Most SMRs however are not expected to come online for another decade. 
                        If executed, these eight projects above will total to over 15,000 MW, enough power for roughly 12 
                        million homes yet only a fraction of forecasted data center demand in the coming decades.

                    <p class="caption">In 2004, the U.S. generated 53% of its electricity from coal-fired power 
                        plants and 19% from natural gas plants. In 2024, coal’s share of production has dropped 
                        to 15% while the share from natural gas has risen to 43%. Since the start of the “shale 
                        revolution” in the early 2000s, natural gas has fallen in price and forced coal plants to 
                        close largely for economic reasons. In addition to using cheaper fuel, natural gas plants 
                        are more flexible and emit less CO2 than coal plants. Lower gas prices have 
                        limited the growth of nuclear energy as well and forced some reactors to close. Of any 
                        technology, wind and solar have grown the most over the past two decades, rising in 
                        their share of electricity production from less than 1% to over 17%.

                    <p class="caption">California continues to rapidly grow its utility-scale solar 
                        capacity. Total solar generation in the state increased by 47% from 2021 to 
                        2024. Sometimes during the day, solar production exceeds the amount that the current transmission system
                        can support, requiring the grid operator to shut off some of the supply. Most 
                        of this curtailment occurs during the spring, when there is ample sun but lower 
                        demand due to moderate temperatures. In March 2025, for example, the 
                        California ISO shut off 18% of total solar generation for the month. To reduce curtailment, 
                        California is expanding its transmission infrastructure and promoting 
                        additional flexible resources such as batteries. Data source: CAISO
