                    <p class="date">October 26, 2025</p>
                    <p class="caption">In April 2023, the California Public Utilities Commission changed the state’s 
                        net-metering policy for rooftop solar. Prior to the change, every kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated 
                        by a customer’s solar panels reduced what they would pay their utility by one kWh. In effect, 
                        instead of buying power at the wholesale rate (roughly 2 to 6 cents per kWh), utilities 
                        were buying power from their customers at the full residential rate (33 cents per kWh). 
                        Utilities need to charge this higher rate to cover their transmission and distribution 
                        costs, including fixed costs such as grid hardening for wildfires. The former net-metering policies shift an estimated $6.5 billion per year onto households without solar panels. 
                        The new policy, often called Net Energy Metering 3.0, aimed to reduce this cost shift. When first implemented, applications for 
                        rooftop solar dropped and the share of homes installing batteries alongside solar panels 
                        rose significantly. While rooftop solar is still critically important, we need incentives 
                        for the technology to accurately reflect the value it provides to the electricity system.

                    <p class="caption">A recent regression analysis by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab studied the factors that 
                        have increased U.S. electricity rates over the past five years. Rates have gone up in regions with rooftop 
                        solar installments, declining system load, or state-led Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). However, 
                        the largest driver of higher bills is simply living in California, as wildfire damage and grid hardening 
                        efforts have created significant transmission and distribution costs for ratepayers in the state. Notably, utility-scale wind and 
                        solar buildout, outside of the 25% attributable to RPS policies, has not exerted upward pressure on 
                        prices. Full study: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2025.107516" target="_blank">LBNL</a>.

                        In 2024, Delta Airlines had a 7.6% pre-tax profit margin; 17% of their company spending was 
                        fuel, almost all of which was fossil-derived (point B). Switching to sustainable aviation 
                        fuel (SAF, point G) as priced now, not factoring in subsidies, would make them unprofitable. 
                        Experts say we need breakthrough technology companies to decarbonize these industries, and 
                        those companies need subsidies to get to scale. The U.S. has several useful subsidies: 
                        Renewable Identification Numbers (RINS) under the renewable fuel standard (RFS); the 
                        lower carbon fuel standard (LCFS) present in California and other west-coast states; 
                        45Z (clean fuels federal tax credit); and 45Q (a highly bipartisan carbon capture tax credit).

                    <p class="caption">U.S. oil and gas companies have reduced their workforce by over 3% since 
                        the start of 2025. Continued output hikes by OPEC+, paired with lukewarm demand from the 
                        world’s largest economies, have weakened oil prices. Crude prices have fallen to $60.53 
                        per barrel, down from the year's high of $78.71 in January. With tighter margins, oil 
                        majors such as Chevron and ExxonMobil are cutting headcount to contain costs. In an 
                        extreme move, upstream company ConocoPhillips announced plans in September to lay off 
                        20–25% of its global workforce, with some employees receiving layoff notifications

                        needed. With a surplus of energy, suppliers need to pay buyers to take it. Generators continue to produce when prices are negative 
                        for two main reasons. Thermal generators often have start-up and shut-down costs making it expensive and time consuming to turn off. 
                        Wind and solar can be curtailed, but the government subsides they receive for producing energy outweigh the negative prices.

                        outages for customers in the 50 states total to seven hours, and without major events this number drops to two hours. Aging infrastructure 
                        and decades from underinvestment from Puerto Rico’s financially challenged utility created an unreliable electricity system on the island. 
                        Severe weather events with inadequate repairs have also compromised the system. While Puerto Rico’s government has taken legislative steps 
                        to improve reliability, significant investment is still needed. Data source: <a href="https://www.eia.gov/" target="_blank">EIA</a>.

                    <p class="caption">Cryptocurrency mining in Texas accounts for roughly 5% of the state’s electricity demand. On summer evenings 
                        however, when the grid faces the most strain, these facilities often shut off. This graph overlays the energy demand from 
                        cryptocurrency mining during each day in June and July this year. On around 40% of evenings, when wholesale prices are highest, 
                        facilities reduce their load by 90-95%. Electricity costs make or break the profitability of a crypto mine. By curtailing 
                        operations, crypto miners not only save money on energy charges (MWh), but also can greatly reduce demand charges (MW). 
                        Transmission utilities levy demand charges using ERCOT’s Four Coincident Peak (4CP) methodology. They charge industrial 
                        customers based on their load during four system-wide peaks, the highest aggregate demand in June, July, August, and September. 
                        By predicting when these peaks might occur, and cutting off power during them, crypto miners can sink their next year’s 
                        demand charges to near $0, saving 10-20% on annual energy costs.

                        by global supply and demand of crude oil. Lower prices in recent months are partly due to OPEC+ output 
                        hikes, including the coalition’s announcement that they will increase production by 548,000 barrels per

                        from $28.92/MW-day to $269.92/MW-day. The 9x increase came from a combination of rising data center load 
                        growth, generator retirements, and changes to PJM’s capacity accreditation methods. In part responding 
                        to a complaint by Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, PJM and FERC approved a two year “price collar” in 
                        the capacity market. This year, prices rose again and hit the price cap at $329.17. The price collar 
                        reduces volatility and protects consumers from cost spikes. However, it also distorts market signals 
                        in a region where supply is already falling behind rising demand.

                        2022, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded federal support for advanced energy

                        service before the end of 2027. The new Act did spare some clean energy technologies,

                        paid an average of 11.56 cents/kWh, while those in Connecticut paid 32.55 cents/kWh—nearly three times 
                        as much. The retail rate reflects the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution, each of which 
                        is impacted by different factors. For example, California’s wildfire mitigation and grid hardening 
                        efforts raise the costs of transmission and distribution. In states with higher wages, taxes, or 
                        clean energy standards, utilities may charge higher rates to cover related costs as well.

                        revolution” in the early 2000s, natural gas has fallen in price and forced coal plants to 
                        close largely for economic reasons. In addition to using cheaper fuel, natural gas plants 
                        are more flexible and emit less CO2 than coal plants. Lower gas prices have 
                        limited the growth of nuclear energy as well and forced some reactors to close. Of any

                    <p class="date">May 18, 2025</p>
                    <p class="caption">Grid operators across the country expect an increase in annual peak demand, the highest electricity load over any hour in a given year, for the first time in two decades. The electrification of industries, homes, and transportation as well as new data centers are driving up forecasts of demand. 
                        Texas, with a growing economy and population, expects peak load to rise from 
                        85 GW in 2024 to 154 GW in 2035, an 80% increase. In the Mid-Atlantic region, PJM, the operator of the nation's largest grid, anticipates a 38% rise in peak power demand this decade, from 151 GW to 209 GW. 
                        The New England system operator expects winter peak demand in the region to grow from 20 GW to 28 GW by 2035, largely due to 
                        the electrification of heating and transportation. Data sources: <a href="https://www.ercot.com/" target="_blank">ERCOT</a>, <a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank">PJM</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/" target="_blank">ISO-NE</a>.</p>

                    <p class="caption">In the three years since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
                        countries in the European Union have reduced their combined imports of Russian natural gas 
                        by 75%. The decrease has been partially offset by a tripling in U.S. liquefied natural gas 
                        imports since the start of 2022. Overall gas imports to Europe have fallen 19% in this 
                        three-year period. This decline is in part due to a reduction in consumption by industries in 
                        response to record high prices as well as a continued shift to renewables and energy 
                        efficiency. On May 5, 2025, the European Commission shared <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0440R(01)" target="_blank">plans</a> to stop all imports of 
                        Russian gas by the end of 2027.  Data source: <a href="https://www.bruegel.org/" target="_blank">Bruegel</a>.</p>

                        and May 1, 2025. Over the past five years, solar has expanded its share, while
                        electricity imports from other western states have declined. Batteries, shown in purple,
                        have become a significant part of the mix in recent years. At 8 pm on May 1, 2025, for example,
                        batteries were supplying 34% of the state's electricity. Data source: California ISO via <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io" target="_blank">Grid Status</a>.</p>
